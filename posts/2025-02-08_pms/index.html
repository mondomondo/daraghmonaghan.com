    </header><p>Every developer I know can complain at length on at least one topic - a passionate, unending rage on a single library, package or convention that defies any reasonable measurement of the issue&rsquo;s actual weight. And that&rsquo;s because life is hell.</p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a fear of mine in technical writing to default to criticism. Developers love complaining. I, as an individual, am prone to complain. So when writing on something within our industry, its very easy to slip into a mode where you point out the imperfections. I say this because this is one topic I absolutely do not want to seem like I&rsquo;m criticising <em>individuals</em> on. Its much worse than that - its advice.</p>
<p>I want to flag one more psychological reflex: we categorize. As humans (doubly-so as developers), our reflex is to put things in boxes. This person carries out X duties, therefore is an X Engineer. This person over here, they&rsquo;re a Y Specialist, therefore they must carry out Y duties. Every workplace will define roles somewhat differently but the wide umbrella that is product and business management, ownership and analysis is so broadly defined that I rarely have any intuitive idea what that person does until I work directly with them - and even then it can be hard to define.</p>
<p>In my mind, there is a role somewhere out there in the aether, maybe already being unofficially, unintentionally performed, that provides massive value. This figure acts as an intermediary, diplomatically bridging the gap between two sides that must <em>never</em> directly communicate: business and development. A dignitary that accepts the words of the business, parses their foreign tongue, determines their hidden intents and translates them into the binary data fed into a slot in the back of the developers&rsquo; heads. The same sentinel can converse with the machine people, relate their experiences to their own, understand what is possible and in turn, relay their concerns to the business. And back and forth this dance continues, until shovels strike earth and life is born. And all this without the use of User Stories.</p>
<p>Another concession is that I have never worked directly with anyone who could be considered a &lsquo;senior&rsquo; member. Presumably, there are individuals out there who can forego some of the chaff of the role that I resent, but I&rsquo;m yet to meet them.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another natural reflex, which is to justify ones existence. Nobody wants to their role as variable, soft or hard-to-define, but sometimes thats just the case. On an ill-fitted, inherently biased one dimensional polital compass, I&rsquo;m quite far left, so I&rsquo;m never going to be the one to argue everyone needs to justify every minute of their employment, but we must get more comfortable with soft-value.</p>
<h3 id="1-be-useless">1. Be useless</h3>
<p>As a [voice of reason] I want [you to dissolve your ego] so that [you may cast off your shackles]
Let go. Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream. Relinquish your grip on the requirements gathering template.</p>
<p>To mention another psychological reflex, which is to justify ones existence. Nobody wants to their role as variable, soft or hard-to-define, but sometimes thats just the case.</p>
<h3 id="2-non-technicality">2. Non-technicality</h3>
<p>self reflective questions. its Ok to acknowledge your lack of material utility. Ask the questions,</p>
<p>Be comfortable being useless. Feel justified in just being there and asking questions. If the right question gets raised, you might have an opportunity to answer a question, but until then, its OK to sit and absorb, and ask the obvious questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also read about the percieved split between product management and business analysis and would love a world in which the role required enough technical knowledge or experience to be able to provide both perspectives. As long as the individual can remain impartial in their technical analysis, the experience can provide massive insight.</p>
<h3 id="3-many-is-the-enemy">3. Many is the enemy</h3>
<p>This goes above product people but do micro face to face meetings, get people in rooms baby,</p>
<p>If product management is the job, is product ownership a behaviour?</p>
